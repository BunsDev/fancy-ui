## Installation

<Steps>

<Step>Install the uuid package:</Step>

<CodeBlockWrapper language="bash">
{`npm install --save @types/uuid uuid`}
</CodeBlockWrapper>

We use the uuid package to generate a unique ID for each trail instance â€” so each trail will work without interfering with other effects.

<Step>Then copy and paste the following code into your project:</Step>

<ComponentSource name="pixel-trail" />

</Steps>

## Examples

### Without fading

If you set the `fadeDuration` prop to `0`, and increase the `delay` prop, you can create a trail effect that doesn't fade.

<ComponentPreview name="pixel-trail-no-fade-demo" />

## Notes

Keep the z-index of the effect's container lower than the rest of your content, so the pointer-events will captured by all of your other elements.
