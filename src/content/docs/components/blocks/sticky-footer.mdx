## How to

This page doesn't contain a component, as achieving a sticky footer doesn't really require any complex logic abstracted away into a component. Some tutorials are tend to overcomplicate this, but for most cases, it's enough to add a few tailwind classes to our elements, which you can find here in this demo.

You need two things to make this work:
- a main element, which will sit on top of the footer. 
- a footer element, which will be behind the main element. 

1. Usually, you want the main element to be **at least** `h-[100vh]` (or `h-[100%]` if you use it insider a container, like in the demo above), so that it fully hides the footer by default. 
2. You also need to set the position to `relative` in order to not mess up the z-indices.
3. Then, set the footer element position to `sticky` and stick to the bottom with `bottom-0`. 
4. Finally, make sure that the main element has a higher z-index than the footer element, so it always sits on top of the footer.

That's it! Can you believe that? 

## Notes

The only drawback in my experience is that the footer element will be always behind the content in the viewport, which sometimes can mess up pointer events, components with z-index modifiers, etc, but 90% of the time it was fine for me.
